#RAPID API: Used Random words and Word dictionary API from RAPID API hub

PROBLEM: As the craze took off, I wanted to play WORDLE more than once a day and decided to code it for myself and my children.

I watched a few videos on different ways to approach the problem and started with CODER CODER (Jessica Chan) who helped me learn about Yeoman and Sass compiler boilerplate. Ania Kubrow taught me how to problem solve with JS.

TEMPLATES/LANGUAGES/FRAMEWORKS USED:
#YEOMAN generator- this was my first exposure to website generators and scaffolding, it made me want to learn more and create a todo react app with the tutorial on the website.

#GULP sass compiler

#AXIOS

#EXPRESS

#CORS

#DOTENV



CHALLENGES:
I have been used to creating SASS folders froms cratch and was a bit thrown by the template at first but found it very useful.

Not being familiar with gulp made it tricky but I decided to continue without it as a compiler and focus on the JS.

The backend code was very new to me having focussed on the frontend but it was fascinating and I look forward to learning about the packages I used in more detail.

The APIs were fun to use but I couldn't get the dictionary API to connect up- I need to go back and focus on this with more learning

uploading to github pages was tricky but I learned about file/folder structure and importance of file/folder nomenclature

FUTURE LEARNING: 
-Learn more about how I can utilise gulp
-Build out the dictionary API 
-Learn more about good folder naming practices
